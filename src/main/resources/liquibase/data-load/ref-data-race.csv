"HALF-ORCS"," Both genders of half-orc stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin"," Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society’s discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, halforcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by the legions of humans who don’t bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods","A lifetime of persecution leaves the average half-orc wary and quick to anger, yet those who break through his savage exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy","Forced to live either among brutish orcs or as lonely outcasts in civilized lands, most half-orcs are bitter, violent, and reclusive"," When they bother to worship the gods, they tend to favor deities who promote warfare or individual strength, such as Gorum, Cayden Cailean, Lamashtu, and Rovagug.","Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot through force of arms","Ausk, Davor, Hakak, Kizziar, Makoa, Nesteruk, Tsadok.","Canan, Drogheda, Goruza, Mazon, Shirish, Tevaga, Zeljka","a3ef6187-c192-4bm9-9812-0c13eaa85c43"

"HUMANS","The physical characteristics of humans are as varied as the world’s climes.","Human society comprises a multitude of governments, attitudes, and lifestyles"," Humans are fecund, and their drive and numbers often spur them into contact with other races during bouts of territorial expansion and colonization.
